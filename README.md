## Hi there 👋
### About me ~ Trying to find a :four::two: to life

###### Some ongoing techy pet projects of mine
- 🔭 I’m currently working on [XINTRA's APT Simulation Labs](https://www.xintra.org/)
  * Here's my work for the [Waifu University Case](https://github.com/Ragmthy/Xintra_Waifu_Uni_Walkthrough) ⏳.
  * It's a simulation lab for threat hunting, and in this Waifu case, about the ALPHV Ransomware gang. It's lovely to be able to piece together the attack and find the relevant artifacts about it.
  * Soon after, I embarked on the [Airbuzzed Case](https://github.com/Ragmthy/Xintra_Airbuzzed_Walkthrough) ~ A simulation lab for the Lazarus Group was targeting employees in aerospace companies for their own motives.
  * Yeah, the labs are addicitve. Here's the write-up for the [Council of Tropical Affairs Lab](https://github.com/Ragmthy/Xintra_Council_of_TropicalAffairs)
  * The next one was the [Abu Jibal Oil Company Lab](https://github.com/Ragmthy/Xintra_Abu_Jibal_OC_Walkthrough)
  * As a finale lab for 2025, I opted to delve into the [KG Distribution](https://github.com/Ragmthy/Xintra_13Cubed_KG_Distribution_Walkthrough) one. It was a mini lab focused into the benefits, and solving out an incident based off the results from running MemProcFS.
 
##### Techy Projects pursued to broaden my Horizon in Cybersecurity: 
- 📆 I've completed the [30 Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWX19cpv21w&list=PLG6KGSNK4PuBb0OjyDIdACZnb8AoNBeq6)
  * Here's my repository for the [project](https://github.com/Ragmthy/30DayMyDFIRChallenge). Just chose to put together a small file for each day covered, as it didn't make full sense to transcribe out the video.
  * As a rough sequence of things one gets to do, you'll get to:
     * Design a system and set its infrastructure and environment up </br>
     * Learn how to collect logs, and monitor the infrastructure </br>
     * Simulate a cyber attack against it, and exfiltrate a particular asset </br>
     * Investigate the captured logs of the attack, and implement protection against the infrastructure.
     * Learn storage of any relevant alerts that came about for audit purposes.

###### An unexpected highlight amongst my works
- :star2: An appreciated repository of mine: the [write-ups for Gralhix OSINT Exercises by Sofia Santos](https://github.com/Ragmthy/gralhix_osint_exercises).
  - A thank you to whomsoever stopped by to read and appreciate it. It wasn't on my bingo card to have an appreciated repository, just intended to write out a thought process for solving these exercises, and keeping it as a knowledge base in case it could be handy in the future. :books:
  - Sincerely, one of the best resources I've stumbled across for getting a better understanding of what OSINT entails and the various case studies designed by SS are incredible. One elegant route to hone problem solving skills :mag:
  - See her [website](https://gralhix.com/list-of-osint-exercises/osint-exercise-031/) to stay tuned for future exercises :brain:

- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her

###### Currently attempting to make this Github Intro page more welcoming. It'll take time ⏳: updating repos are more fun than the about me md 
In the meantime, enjoy some quotes here from THHGttG:
- "Don't Panic. It's the first helpful or intelligible thing anybody's said to me all day." ❗
- "Looking up into the night sky is looking into infinity — distance is incomprehensible and therefore meaningless" 🌃
- "Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so." 🕧🥪🍴
