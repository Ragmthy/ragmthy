## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### Trying to find a 42 to life

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [XINTRA's APT Simulation Labs](https://www.xintra.org/)

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her

- Currently attempting to jazz up this Github Intro page, should be loading soon
- In the meantime, enjoy some quotes here from THHGttG:
- "Don't Panic. It's the first helpful or intelligible thing anybody's said to me all day."
- "Looking up into the night sky is looking into infinity â€” distance is incomprehensible and therefore meaningless"
- "Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so."
