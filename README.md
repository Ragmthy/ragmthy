## Hi there 👋
### Trying to find a :four::two: to life

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [XINTRA's APT Simulation Labs](https://www.xintra.org/)
  * Here's my work in progress for the [Waifu University Case](https://github.com/Ragmthy/Xintra_Waifu_Uni_Walkthrough) ⏳
 
- :star2: An appreciated repository of mine: the [write-ups for Gralhix OSINT Exercises by Sofia Santos](https://github.com/Ragmthy/gralhix_osint_exercises).
  - A thank you to whomsoever stopped by to read and appreciate it. It wasn't on my bingo card to have an appreciated repository, just intended to write out a thought process for solving these exercises, and keeping it as a knowledge base for help in case it could be handy in the future. :books:
  - Sincerely, one of the best resources I've stumbled across for getting a better understanding of what OSINT entails and the various case studies designed by SS are incredible. One elegant route to hone problem solving skills :mag:
  - See her [website](https://gralhix.com/list-of-osint-exercises/osint-exercise-031/) to stay tuned for future exercises :brain:

- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her

###### Currently attempting to jazz up this Github Intro page, should be loading soon ⏳
In the meantime, enjoy some quotes here from THHGttG:
- "Don't Panic. It's the first helpful or intelligible thing anybody's said to me all day." ❗
- "Looking up into the night sky is looking into infinity — distance is incomprehensible and therefore meaningless" 🌃
- "Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so." 🕧🥪🍴
